**Accessibility** (**a11y**), more specifically **web accessibility** or **eAccessibility**, is the practice of building inclusive spaces for different people, either by supporting the use of [assistive technology](https://github.com/topics/assistive-technology) (ALT text, ARIA HTML attributes, etc.) or by designing things with multiple ways to access them (color coding + text labels + icons, captions + sign language interpreter), keeping in mind different forms of impairments, disabilities, and difficulties—both temporary and permanent—, users of these space could face and might struggle with while using the space, which include:  

* Visual impairments, e.g.
    * color blindness/color vision deficiency
    * blindness/low vision/poor eyesight
* Motor/mobility, e.g.
    * tremors
    * loss of fine muscle control,
* Auditory impairment/hearing impairments, e.g.
    * people who are hard of hearing
    * deafness 
* Seizures
* Cognitive and intellectual, e.g.
    *  developmental disabilities
    *  learning difficulties (dyslexia, dyscalculia, etc.)
    *  cognitive disabilities (PTSD, Alzheimer's)
